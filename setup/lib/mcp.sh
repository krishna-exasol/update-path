# mcp.sh — Exasol MCP server module (the AI agent bridge).
#
# Sourced by setup scripts after common.sh, detect.sh, a runtime module, and
# exapump.sh. Installs uv if needed, prepares MCP client configurations, and
# validates that the server starts and answers over stdio.
#
# Server facts:
#   - PyPI package exasol-mcp-server; run: uvx exasol-mcp-server@<version>
#   - config env: EXA_DSN, EXA_USER, EXA_PASSWORD, EXA_SSL_CERT_VALIDATION
#   - HTTP mode: exasol-mcp-server-http --host <h> --port <p>
#   - the server's tools are read-only (metadata + data reading queries);
#     a least-privilege database user adds defense in depth
#
# Guardrail layering:
#   1. server is read-only by design
#   2. dedicated read-only database user, provisioned and posture-checked by
#      exakit_configure_mcp_readonly_access in common.sh
#   3. permanent client setup (handled by the Python mcp package) points at
#      that user, never the admin user

# Legacy fallback used only when older manifest state does not yet contain the
# validated connection block. Keep it aligned with the provisioned read-only
# database user name.
