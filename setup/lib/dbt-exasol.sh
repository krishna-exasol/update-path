# dbt-exasol.sh — dbt-exasol (the dbt adapter for Exasol): managed install +
# validation.
#
# A MARKETPLACE ADD-ON: never installed by the setup scripts. The user picks it
# from `exakit marketplace`; once installed it joins `exakit update` like every
# other component. Sourced by the exakit CLI after common.sh.
#
# dbt-exasol facts:
#   - The dbt adapter for Exasol (github.com/exasol/dbt-exasol), published to
#     PyPI as `dbt-exasol`. It pulls dbt-core in with it, so installing this
#     add-on is what puts dbt on the machine.
#   - A CLI, not a service: nothing listens, nothing starts at boot. That is why
#     this module defines no status/start/stop/autostart/log hooks — the generic
#     registry arms simply leave those surfaces out for an add-on that does not
#     run.
#   - PyPI is both the install source and the version authority, which is why
#     versions.json carries `package` and NO `repo` for it: the generic upstream
#     lookup prefers `repo`, and the GitHub tags are v-prefixed (v1.12.1) while
#     the PyPI versions are not (1.12.1).
#   - Nothing to checksum. A PyPI version is immutable — it can never be
#     re-uploaded — so `dbt-exasol==<version>` IS the pin, in the way a digest is
#     the pin for the add-ons that install a GitHub release asset (those can be
#     deleted and re-uploaded under the same tag; this cannot).
#   - Requires Python >=3.11,<3.15. The kit's managed interpreter
#     (EXAKIT_MANAGED_PYTHON_VERSION, 3.12) sits inside that range, so there is
#     no version gate here — if that constant ever moves outside it, the install
#     fails loudly at pip rather than silently producing a broken venv.
#
#   - venv:     $EXAKIT_HOME/dbt-exasol-venv
#   - profile:  $EXAKIT_HOME/dbt/profiles.yml  (NEVER ~/.dbt/profiles.yml)
#   - launcher: $EXAKIT_BIN_DIR/dbt-exasol
#
# Safe to re-run: an existing venv with the desired version installed is kept,
# and the profile and launcher are regenerated so a DSN or credential change
# since the install is picked up.

# The add-on's version constants live here, next to the code that uses them —
# the generic registry arms in common.sh find them by the derived name
# convention (EXAKIT_<ID>_VERSION[_FALLBACK]), and the versions-bump workflow
# keeps the fallback in lockstep with versions.json (COUPLED table).
