#
# Sourced by setup scripts after common.sh and detect.sh. Installs the Exasol
# launcher from the resolved GitHub release (checksum-verified) and deploys a
# local database with `exasol install local`.
#
# Launcher facts:
#   - release assets: exasol-personal_macOS_{arm64,x86_64}.tar.gz + checksums
#   - local deployment needs macOS with at least 8 GB RAM
#   - deployment state: ~/.exasol/personal/deployments/default
#   - `exasol info` prints connection details for the current deployment
#   - rerunning `exasol install local` with the same preset is safe

# database can act on, and all of whose useful parts the kit restates in its own
# closing panel. So the stream is consumed rather than shown: each line is
# matched against the launcher's own milestone messages, and one line is redrawn
# in place with a bar, a percentage and the phase in plain English.
#
# Nothing is lost by hiding it. Every raw line still goes to the logfile exactly
# as before; a copy is kept so a FAILED deploy can print the launcher's own last
# words instead of only a log path; and the launcher's EULA notice -- the one
# part of that output the user genuinely must see -- is replayed afterwards, in

# unrecognised line simply does not move the bar, which is what makes a launcher
# release that renames a message degrade to a slower-looking bar instead of to a
# wrong one. The percentages are milestone positions, not a measured fraction of
# the work: the bar moves only when the launcher has actually reached the next
