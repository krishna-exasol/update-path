# runtime-personal.sh — Exasol Personal local runtime module (macOS).
#
# Sourced by setup scripts after common.sh and detect.sh. Installs the Exasol
# launcher from the resolved GitHub release (checksum-verified) and deploys a
# local database with `exasol install local`.
#
# Launcher facts:
#   - release assets: exasol-personal_macOS_{arm64,x86_64}.tar.gz + checksums
#   - local deployment needs macOS with at least 8 GB RAM
#   - deployment state: ~/.exasol/personal/deployments/default
#   - `exasol info` prints connection details for the current deployment
#   - rerunning `exasol install local` with the same preset is safe
