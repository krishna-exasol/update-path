# runtime-personal.sh — Exasol Personal local runtime module (macOS and Linux).
#
# Sourced by setup scripts after common.sh and detect.sh. Installs the Exasol
# launcher from the resolved GitHub release (checksum-verified) and deploys a
# local database with `exasol install local`.
#
# Launcher facts:
#   - release assets: exasol-personal_{macOS,Linux}_{arm64,x86_64}.tar.gz
#     + checksums; Linux local deployments exist from launcher 2.3 and need
#     Podman (rootless is fine) — the launcher does not install it on Linux
#   - local deployment needs at least 8 GB RAM
#   - deployment state: ~/.exasol/personal/deployments/default
#   - `exasol info` prints connection details for the current deployment
#   - rerunning `exasol install local` with the same preset is safe

# --- deployment progress ----------------------------------------------------
# `exasol install local` narrates itself in structured JSON and then prints a
# forty-line connection overview -- none of which the person waiting for a
# database can act on, and all of whose useful parts the kit restates in its own
# closing panel. So the stream is consumed rather than shown: each line is
# matched against the launcher's own milestone messages, and one line is redrawn
# in place with a bar, a percentage and the phase in plain English.
#
# Nothing is lost by hiding it. Every raw line still goes to the logfile exactly
# as before; a copy is kept so a FAILED deploy can print the launcher's own last
# words instead of only a log path; and the launcher's EULA notice -- the one
# part of that output the user genuinely must see -- is replayed afterwards, in
# the launcher's own words rather than a copy of them that could go stale.

# _personal_deploy_milestone <line> — "<pct>|<phase>" for a line that marks
# progress, nothing for any other line.
#
# The strings are the launcher's own log messages, matched as plain substrings
# rather than as JSON so that a switch to text logging keeps working. An
# unrecognised line simply does not move the bar, which is what makes a launcher
# release that renames a message degrade to a slower-looking bar instead of to a
# wrong one. The percentages are milestone positions, not a measured fraction of
# the work: the bar moves only when the launcher has actually reached the next
# stage, and the elapsed counter -- which ticks every second whatever the
# launcher is doing -- is what says "still alive" in between.
#
# KEEP EVERY PHASE TO 21 CHARACTERS OR FEWER. The phase gets 30% of the progress
# line: 21 columns on an 80-column terminal, 27 on a 100, and never more than 33
# however wide the window is opened. Anything longer is ellipsed -- and a phrase

# questions (EXAKIT_REUSE_DB, EXAKIT_REPLACE_DB) before it gets here. A launcher
# that does not know the flag is never handed it — an unknown flag is a hard
# failure, and 2.2 deployments are still supported.
