# dbt-exasol.ps1 - dbt-exasol (the dbt adapter for Exasol): managed install +
# validation.
#
# Windows counterpart of dbt-exasol.sh. A MARKETPLACE ADD-ON: never installed
# by the setup scripts. The user picks it from `exakit marketplace`; once
# installed it joins `exakit update` like every other component.
#
# dbt-exasol facts:
#   - The dbt adapter for Exasol (github.com/exasol/dbt-exasol), published to
#     PyPI as dbt-exasol. It pulls dbt-core in with it, so installing this
#     add-on is what puts dbt on the machine.
#   - A CLI, not a service: nothing listens, nothing starts at boot. That is
#     why this module defines no status/start/stop/autostart/log functions -
#     the marketplace registry entry simply names none.
#   - PyPI is both the install source and the version authority, which is why
#     versions.json carries `package` and NO `repo` for it: the generic
#     upstream lookup prefers `repo`, and the GitHub tags are v-prefixed
#     (v1.12.1) while the PyPI versions are not (1.12.1).
#   - Nothing to checksum. A PyPI version is immutable - it can never be
#     re-uploaded - so dbt-exasol==<version> IS the pin, in the way a digest
#     is the pin for the add-ons that install a GitHub release asset.
#   - Requires Python >=3.11,<3.15; the kit's managed interpreter (3.12) sits
#     inside that range.
#
#   - venv:     ~\.exasol-starter-kit\dbt-exasol-venv
#   - profile:  ~\.exasol-starter-kit\dbt\profiles.yml  (NEVER ~\.dbt)
#   - launcher: ~\.local\bin\dbt-exasol.cmd
#
# Requires exakit-common.ps1 dot-sourced first. Safe to re-run: an existing
# venv with the desired version installed is kept as-is.

# The add-on's version constants live here, next to the code that uses them -
# the marketplace registry entry in exakit-common.ps1 names them, and the
# versions-bump workflow keeps the fallback in lockstep with versions.json
# (COUPLED table).
