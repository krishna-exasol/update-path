# Sourced by install.sh and setup-*.sh. Pure read-only checks, no side effects.
# Compatible with bash 3.2 and POSIX sh — every function here must also run
# under dash/ash. The one bash-only feature this file uses, the /dev/tcp probe
# in port_in_use, is now guarded by $BASH_VERSION and has a POSIX fallback, so
# the claim on this line is true rather than aspirational: read it before
# reaching for a bashism.
