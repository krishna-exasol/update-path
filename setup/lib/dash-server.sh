# dash-server.sh — dash-server (AI dashboard host): managed install + validation.
#
# A MARKETPLACE ADD-ON: never installed by the setup scripts. The user picks it
# from `exakit marketplace`; once installed it joins `exakit update` like every
# other component. Sourced by the exakit CLI after common.sh.
#
# dash-server facts:
#   - Agent-operated Dash hosting server for Exasol-backed dashboards
#     (github.com/exasol-labs/dash-server): agents build/deploy dashboards
#     through its MCP control plane (Streamable HTTP at /mcp), users open a
#     browser URL.
#   - Pure-Python package with a `dash-server` console script; releases carry
#     no prebuilt binaries, so the install is `uv pip install` of the tag's
#     source tarball into a dedicated venv under the kit home — the same
#     tag-pinned, package-manager-verified posture as the mcp and pyexasol
#     components. (GitHub source tarballs have no stable published digest, so
#     there is nothing kit-side to pin a checksum against.)
#   - Control plane: 127.0.0.1:5100 by default (env DASH_SERVER_HOST/PORT).
#   - Exasol profile bootstrap at startup via DASH_SERVER_EXASOL_* env vars;
#     the launcher below feeds it the kit's local database.
#
#   - venv:     $EXAKIT_HOME/dash-server-venv
#   - state:    $EXAKIT_HOME/dash-server/instance (GitOps repo, apps, secrets)
#   - launcher: $EXAKIT_BIN_DIR/dash-server (bootstraps env, then execs the venv
#               console script)
#
# Safe to re-run: an existing venv with the desired version installed is kept.

# The add-on's version constants live here, next to the code that uses them —
# the generic registry arms in common.sh find them by the derived name
# convention (EXAKIT_<ID>_VERSION[_FALLBACK]), and the versions-bump workflow
# keeps the fallback in lockstep with versions.json (COUPLED table).
