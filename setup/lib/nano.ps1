# --- finding Docker Desktop -------------------------------------------------
# `Get-Command docker` alone is not enough to answer "is Docker installed?" on
# Windows, and treating it as the answer produced the kit's most confusing
# report: Docker Desktop plainly installed and working - `docker` runs inside
# WSL, `wsl -l` lists the docker-desktop distro - while the Windows installer
# said "No container runtime found. Install Docker Desktop".
#
# The cause is PATH, not Docker. Docker Desktop adds its bin directory to the
# MACHINE PATH at install time, and an already-open PowerShell (or the parent
# that spawned it, or a terminal restored by Windows Terminal at logon) keeps
# the environment block it started with. Until that shell is restarted,
# docker.exe exists on disk and is simply not on $env:PATH. The WSL side never
# sees this because its docker comes from Docker Desktop's WSL integration,
# which injects the CLI into the distro independently.
#
# So: look for the real docker.exe in the places Docker Desktop installs it
# (and where the registry says it went), and use the full path when found.
