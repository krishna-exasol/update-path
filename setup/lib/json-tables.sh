#!/usr/bin/env bash
# json-tables.sh — JSON Tables (ingest, query and reshape JSON-shaped data in
# Exasol): managed install + validation.
#
# A MARKETPLACE ADD-ON: never installed by the setup scripts. Sourced by the
# exakit CLI after common.sh.
#
# What upstream ships, and why this module looks the way it does:
#   - exasol-labs/exasol-json-tables is a Python package (`exasol-json-tables`,
#     console script of the same name) PLUS a Rust ingest engine (crate
#     json_tables_ingest, binary `json_to_parquet`).
#   - Its wheel contains only python/exasol_json_tables — the crate source is
#     not in it — and the CLI runs the engine with exactly one call shape:
#         cargo run --manifest-path <root>/crates/json_tables_ingest/Cargo.toml -- ...
#     There is no environment variable or PATH lookup for a prebuilt engine.
#     So a wheel-only install cannot ingest even on a machine WITH Rust: the
#     manifest path it points at does not exist inside site-packages.
#   - The kit therefore does three things: install the wheel, install the
#     prebuilt engine for this platform, and put a tiny `cargo` shim in front
#     of the CLI that turns that one call into a direct engine run. The shim
#     is visible ONLY to processes started by the kit's launcher — the user's
#     real cargo, if any, is untouched everywhere else.
#
# Nothing is compiled here: the engine binaries and the wheel are built once by
# .github/workflows/pkg-json-tables.yml and published to the kit repository's
# `mirror-json-tables` release, so a user never needs Rust or cargo. When
# upstream gains a documented way to point at a prebuilt engine, the shim is
# the only piece that goes away.

# _json_tables_restore_package_data — put back data files upstream ships in
# its source tree but does NOT declare as wheel package data, so pip never
# installs them.
#
# UPSTREAM BUG (exasol-json-tables, at least through 41ddd51a9a33):
# pyproject's packaging covers the .py modules under python/exasol_json_tables
# but not python/exasol_json_tables/preprocessor_assets/jvs_preprocessor_lib.lua,
# so every prebuilt wheel is missing it. `ingest` (writing Parquet) is
# unaffected; `ingest-and-wrap` and `wrap` fail with FILE-NOT-FOUND once they
# reach the step that installs the preprocessor into Exasol.
#
# Rather than ship a broken wrap step, restore any non-.py file upstream's
# source tree has and the installed wheel lacks, fetched from the exact
# commit the mirror release was built from. Nothing is overwritten, so a
# fixed release simply makes this a no-op. ⇄ twin:
