#!/usr/bin/env bash
# runtime-nano.sh — Exasol Nano container runtime module (Linux, WSL, Windows).
#
# Sourced by setup scripts after common.sh and detect.sh. Runs the resolved
# exasol/nano image tag under Docker (preferred) or Podman (fallback), with:
#   - a persistent named volume for /exa (database state survives restarts)
#   - the SQL port bound to localhost only
#   - a generated SYS password injected on first deployment via secret mount
#
# Container contract (from the image documentation):
#   - readiness: logs print "Database is now up and running!"
#   - connection: 127.0.0.1:8563, user sys, TLS (self-signed certificate)
#   - recommended limits: --shm-size=512mb --pids-limit=-1
