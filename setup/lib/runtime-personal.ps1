# helper this module leans on (Info/Ok/Warn2/Fail, the manifest, credentials,
# bounded probes, downloads) lives there.
#
# Launcher facts, from the same release this module downloads:
#   - the Windows asset is exasol-personal_Windows_x86_64.zip + checksums;
#     there is NO Windows arm64 local deployment
#   - the database runs through HOST Podman inside Podman's default machine;
#     a missing Podman is offered for install by the launcher itself (winget,
#     possibly with an administrator prompt) - the kit never installs it
#   - that default machine is shared host-wide: the launcher never reconfigures
#     an existing one and leaves it running after stop and destroy, so this
#     module owns the DEPLOYMENT and nothing else
#   - deployment state: ~\.exasol\personal\deployments\default
#   - from 2.3, non-interactive host preparation FAILS without --auto-approve;
#     the flag is probed per subcommand exactly as the sh side does
