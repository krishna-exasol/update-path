# legacy-crossing.sh — moving an installation made by an OLDER kit onto this one.
#
# Older kits (this one before the container runtime was removed, and the
# upstream exasol-labs/exasol-personal-local-starterkit) could deploy the
# database as a CONTAINER. This kit deploys Exasol Personal and nothing else,
# so an installation whose manifest records a container database has a database
# that nothing in this tree can drive.
#
# This module is the ONE place that touches such an installation, and the way it
# touches it matters: it reads the manifest the old kit wrote and shells out to
# the recorded engine for exactly three verbs — inspect, start, stop. It does
# not reintroduce a runtime, it cannot deploy a container, and nothing outside
# the crossing calls into it. When the crossing is done the module has no work
# left to do on that machine, for ever.
#
# THE ORDER IS FORCED BY THE PORT. The old container is listening on the port
# the new deployment wants, so the container must be stopped before the deploy —
# on BOTH answers, including the one that keeps it. And the data can only be
# read while it is still up. That is why the crossing is in two halves with the
# install between them:
#
#   legacy_crossing_before   read the tables out, stop the container   (before step 1)
#   ... the install runs: launcher, deployment, exapump ...
#   legacy_crossing_after    ask, restore into the new database        (before the sample data)
#
# THE COPY IS MADE BEFORE THE QUESTION, which is the one thing here that looks
# backwards and is not. The container can only be read while it holds the port,
# and it holds the port only until the deployment takes it - so the first half
# is the only moment the data can be reached at all. Asking there meant asking
# before the kit had installed a single thing, about a database the user may
# have forgotten they had. So the tables are read out silently into a directory
# under the kit's own home, and the question waits for the place it belongs:
# after exapump, before the sample data, where a database is up, an exapump
# binary exists and the profile points at the NEW database. A "no" there
# deletes the copy; nothing in the old container is changed either way, and no
# data leaves this machine.
#
# WHAT IS NEVER DONE: the old container and its data volume are not deleted, on
# either answer. A migration that has just copied data out is exactly the wrong
# moment to destroy the only other copy, and "skip" means skip. The container is
# left stopped, named on screen, with the one command that removes it.
#
# AFTER THE INSTALL there is one more road, `exakit migrate docker-nano`
# (legacy_migrate_now, at the end of this file): the same copy, in one sitting,
# for someone who answered "skip" and changed their mind, or whose container the
# installer never saw. And on BOTH roads the kit's own bundled sample data is
# left out of the copy: the install loads it itself, and `exakit data-load` puts
# it back any time (see "the kit's own sample data" below).
#
# Twin: setup/lib/legacy-crossing.ps1. Keep the two in step.

# Where the export lands. Under the kit home rather than /tmp: it holds the
# user's data and it has to survive a reboot between the two halves of a

# and wants the data after all, or whose container the installer never saw (made
# by hand, or by the upstream kit on a machine this kit was installed fresh on),
# still has a database in a container - and this is the same copy, in one
# sitting: the old database is read, its tables restored into the deployment
# that is already running, the kit's own sample data left where it is.
#
# THE PORT IS THE COMPLICATION. Both databases want 8563. When the container
# publishes the deployment's port, the deployment is stopped for the copy out
# and started again before the copy in; when it does not (a container started
# on another port), nothing is stopped. The container itself ends as it began -
# except that one holding the deployment's port stays stopped, because the
# deployment has to have it back.
