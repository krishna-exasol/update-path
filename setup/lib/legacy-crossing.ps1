# legacy-crossing.ps1 - moving an installation made by an OLDER kit onto this one.
#
# Twin of setup/lib/legacy-crossing.sh. Read that file's header for the whole
# rationale; the short version is that older kits (this one before the
# container runtime was removed, and the upstream
# exasol-labs/exasol-personal-local-starterkit) could deploy the database as a
# CONTAINER, and this kit deploys Exasol Personal and nothing else. An
# installation whose manifest records a container database therefore has a
# database that nothing in this tree can drive.
#
# This module is the ONE place that touches such an installation, through the
# manifest the old kit wrote and three engine verbs - inspect, start, stop. It
# does not reintroduce a runtime and it cannot deploy a container.
#
# THE ORDER IS FORCED BY THE PORT: the old container is listening on the port
# the new deployment wants, so it is stopped before the deploy on BOTH answers,
# and the data can only be read while it is still up. Hence two halves:
#
#   Invoke-LegacyCrossingBefore   ask, export, stop        (before step 1)
#   ... the install runs ...
#   Invoke-LegacyCrossingAfter    restore                  (after the kit steps)
#
# WHAT IS NEVER DONE: the old container and its data volume are not deleted, on
# either answer. The container is left stopped, named on screen, with the one
# command that removes it.
#
# AFTER THE INSTALL there is one more road, `exakit migrate docker-nano`
# (Invoke-LegacyMigrateNow, at the end of this file): the same copy in one
# sitting, for someone who answered "skip" and changed their mind, or whose
# container the installer never saw. On BOTH roads the kit's own bundled sample
# data is left out of the copy: the install loads it itself, and `exakit
# data-load` puts it back any time.

# Under the kit home rather than %TEMP%: it holds the user's data and has to
# survive a reboot between the two halves of a resumed install.

# sitting: the old database is read, its tables restored into the deployment
# that is already running, the kit's own sample data left where it is.

# which stays stopped because the deployment has to have it back.
