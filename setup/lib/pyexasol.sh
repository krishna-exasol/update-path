# pyexasol.sh — pyexasol (Exasol Python driver): managed install + validation.
#
# Installs the official Exasol Python driver (github.com/exasol/pyexasol)
# into a dedicated uv-managed virtual environment under $EXAKIT_HOME, so
# users can script against the local database from Python immediately —
# without touching the system interpreter or any of their own projects.
#
#   - PyPI package: pyexasol
#   - venv:         $EXAKIT_HOME/pyexasol-venv
#   - use it:       ~/.exasol-starter-kit/pyexasol-venv/bin/python
#                       >>> import pyexasol
#
# Requires common.sh sourced first. Safe to re-run: an existing venv with
# the desired version installed is kept as-is.
