# The Windows exapump.exe build can return a NON-ZERO exit code even when the

# SELECT 1 1 rows" and exits non-zero), so exit code alone is not a reliable
# success signal on Windows. macOS/Linux exapump exits 0 on success, so exit
# code 0 is still trusted as the fast path; a non-zero exit is only treated
# as failure when the *output* actually looks like an error. This keeps
# behavior identical where exit codes are reliable and recovers correctly
# where they are not, while still catching genuine failures (auth, refused
# connection, syntax errors) which always print error text.

# Invoke-ExapumpSqlFile <file> [description] - execute a SQL file, logged.
# Returns $true/$false instead of dying so callers (Invoke-ExakitSampleDataLoad)
# can decide whether a missing/empty file is fatal.
# Invoke-ExapumpSqlFileCapture <file> - feed a SQL file to exapump's stdin and
# return a structured result ({ Output; ExitCode; Success }) matching
# Invoke-Exapump's shape, logging the invocation. Shared by
# Invoke-ExapumpSqlFile (needs only pass/fail) and the sample-data verification
# step (also scans output for FAIL rows), so the stdin feed + quirk-aware
# success detection lives in one place.
#
# The file's RAW BYTES are handed to exapump via System.Diagnostics.Process,
# NOT a PowerShell pipeline (Get-Content -Raw | exapump 2>&1). Two independent
# Windows PowerShell 5.1 behaviors made the pipeline form silently destroy the
# sample-data load:
#   1. Under the module-global $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop', 2>&1 turned
#      exapump's first stderr progress line into a terminating error that tore
#      the pipeline down - killing exapump at statement 1 of the batch - while
#      the lone captured "[1/10] ..." line satisfied Test-ExapumpSucceeded's
#      [n/m] marker, so schema creation reported "done" without CREATE SCHEMA
#      ever running.
#   2. Under the system-wide UTF-8 codepage (65001), a UTF-8 BOM gets
#      prepended to whatever reaches exapump's stdin, and Exasol rejects the
#      batch's first statement: "'<U+FEFF>' character is not allowed within
#      unquoted identifier". PowerShell's own pipe writer adds one (even with
#      $OutputEncoding set to ASCII or BOM-less UTF-8), and on .NET Framework
#      Process.StandardInput adds another: merely accessing that property
#      builds a StreamWriter over Console.InputEncoding (BOM-emitting UTF-8
#      under CP 65001) with AutoFlush = $true, whose setter flushes the
#      encoder preamble into the pipe before any payload byte. Verified: with
#      Console.InputEncoding left alone the probe payload arrives as
#      EF BB BF + bytes on 5.1; with a BOM-less UTF-8 InputEncoding it
#      arrives byte-exact (and PowerShell 7 is byte-exact either way).
# Raw-byte stdin bypasses every re-encoding layer, and keeping exapump's
# stderr out of PowerShell's error stream sidesteps the 'Stop' teardown too.
# stdout/stderr reads start BEFORE stdin is written to avoid the classic
# full-pipe deadlock.
