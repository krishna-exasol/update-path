# The marketplace: optional add-ons, and how to add one

The marketplace is the kit's home for **optional tools** — things worth having
next to the database but not worth lengthening the install for. dash-server
(the AI dashboard host) is the first one.

This document is two things: a short tour of how the marketplace behaves, and
the **complete walkthrough for adding a new add-on** — which is deliberately
three additive changes with no case-statement surgery anywhere.

For the user-journey view — fresh install, existing kit, update path, every
scenario as a flowchart — see [MARKETPLACE-FLOWS.md](MARKETPLACE-FLOWS.md).

---

## How it behaves (the contract)

- **Never in the install flow.** The setup scripts install nothing from the
  marketplace. After a successful interactive install, the closing screen
  says *"Your Starter Kit installation is done and working"* and asks one
  gate question as a cursor selection — *Do you want to add optional tools?*
  with Yes pre-ticked and No as the opt-out. Yes opens the marketplace
  selection, where the available add-ons come pre-selected (exactly like the
  data-load menu pre-selects pending datasets), so Enter installs them and
  Cancel still backs out; No prints the one command to come back with. No
  typing anywhere.
- **`exakit marketplace`** is the command: every add-on with a one-line
  description, Space selects, Enter installs. Non-interactive runs (agents,
  CI) answer with `EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=<ids csv | all | none>` instead —
  this also pre-answers the closing offer.
- **Dynamic by presence.** An add-on already on the machine is never
  advertised — whether the kit installed it (shown as *installed (vX)*) or it
  was already on the system outside the kit (shown as *already on this system —
  the kit leaves it alone*; the kit never updates or uninstalls what it did
  not install). When everything is present, the offer and the discovery lines
  disappear entirely.
- **Installed add-ons are full components.** They join `exakit update` /
  `exakit update-check`, report in `exakit version`, pin with
  `EXAKIT_<ID>_VERSION`, and are swept by `exakit uninstall`. Add-ons you never
  picked are never touched by `update all`.

## Where the pieces live

| Piece | bash | PowerShell |
|---|---|---|
| Registry + menu + offer + generic arms | `setup/lib/common.sh` (marketplace block) | `setup/lib/exakit-common.ps1` (marketplace block), registry arms in `setup/exakit.ps1` |
| The add-on itself | `setup/lib/<id>.sh` | `setup/lib/<id>.ps1` |
| CLI entry point | `setup/exakit` (`cmd_marketplace`) | `setup/exakit.ps1` (`Invoke-CmdMarketplace`) |
| Closing offer call | `setup/setup-macos.sh`, `setup/setup-wsl.sh` | `setup/setup-windows-docker.ps1` |

Every registry function — version block, env override, fallback, upstream
lookup, installed probe, update targets and dispatch — resolves a registered
add-on through **one generic arm driven by conventions**, so a new add-on
needs no edits there. The conventions, for an id like `my-tool`:

| Convention | Value for `my-tool` |
|---|---|
| Module functions (bash; dashes → underscores) | `my_tool_install`, `my_tool_validate`, `my_tool_update`, `my_tool_installed_version` |
| Version env override / fallback (bash) | `EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION`, `EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION_FALLBACK` |
| versions.json block | `components.my-tool` (`repo` = GitHub release, `package` = PyPI — the generic upstream lookup reads whichever is present) |
| Manifest keys | `components.my_tool.*`, `desired.my_tool` |
| Kit-managed state | venv/state under `$EXAKIT_HOME`, launcher at `$EXAKIT_BIN_DIR/my-tool` (swept by uninstall automatically, by registry id) |
| PowerShell functions | named explicitly in the registry entry (no derivation) |

## Adding a new add-on: the walkthrough

Three changes, one PR. `setup/lib/dash-server.sh` / `.ps1` are the reference
implementation — copy them when in doubt.

### 1. Ship the module pair

**`setup/lib/my-tool.sh`** — the skeleton every add-on follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# my-tool.sh — my-tool (<one-line purpose>): managed install + validation.
# A MARKETPLACE ADD-ON: never installed by the setup scripts.

# The add-on's version constants live here, next to the code that uses them —
# the generic registry arms find them by the derived-name convention, and the
# versions-bump workflow keeps the fallback in lockstep with versions.json.
EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION="${EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION:-}"
EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION_FALLBACK="${EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION_FALLBACK:-1.0.0}"
EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_REPO="${EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_REPO:-exasol-labs/my-tool}"

# The live probe: answer with the installed version, FAIL for a provably
# absent install. This is what keeps a stale manifest record from ever
# claiming "installed".
my_tool_installed_version() {
    # e.g. "$venv_python" -c 'from importlib.metadata import version; ...'
    return 1
}

# Soft-fail helper: marketplace installs must never end the caller's run.
_my_tool_not_installed() {
    warn "my-tool was not installed: $1"
    warn "Everything else in the kit is unaffected. Retry with: exakit update my-tool"
    command -v exakit_note_failure >/dev/null 2>&1 && exakit_note_failure "$1"
    manifest_set components.my_tool.validated false
    return 1
}

my_tool_install() {
    # The marketplace path runs from the exakit CLI, where the installer's
    # version resolution has not run — resolve the advertised version here.
    if [ -z "${EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION:-}" ]; then
        EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION="$(exakit_component_available my-tool 2>/dev/null || true)"
        [ -n "$EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION" ] || EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION="$EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION_FALLBACK"
        export EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION
    fi
    # ... install (venv under $EXAKIT_HOME, launcher in $EXAKIT_BIN_DIR) ...
    # On any failure: _my_tool_not_installed "<reason>"; return 1
    manifest_set components.my_tool.version "$EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION"
}

# Prove it actually works; record validated=true/false. Soft — return 0 even
# when validation fails (the failure has already explained itself).
my_tool_validate() {
    manifest_set components.my_tool.validated true
    return 0
}

# Install the advertised version. Doubles as the repair command; asked for
# explicitly, so a failure here IS a failure (die).
my_tool_update() {
    _available="$(exakit_component_available my-tool 2>/dev/null || true)"
    [ -n "$_available" ] || die "Could not resolve the advertised my-tool version."
    _current="$(my_tool_installed_version 2>/dev/null || true)"
    if [ -n "$_current" ] && [ "$_current" = "$_available" ]; then
        ok "my-tool is already current ($_current)"
        return 0
    fi
    EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION="$_available"
    export EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION
    my_tool_install || die "my-tool could not be installed — see the warning above."
    my_tool_validate || true
    manifest_set desired.my_tool "$EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION"
    ok "my-tool updated; database data was not changed"
}

# OPTIONAL: sharpen "already on this system" detection beyond the default
# same-named-binary-on-PATH check.
# my_tool_system_present() { ... }
```

**`setup/lib/my-tool.ps1`** — the twin. Same shape with the house verbs
(`Install-MyTool`, `Test-MyTool`, `Update-MyTool`, `Get-MyToolInstalledVersion`,
`Write-MyToolNotInstalled`) and its own
`$script:MyToolVersionFallback = if ($env:EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION_FALLBACK) { $env:EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION_FALLBACK } else { "1.0.0" }`.

Hard rules for both files (CI enforces them):

- bash stays **3.2**-compatible (macOS default); PowerShell stays **5.1**-
  compatible (no ternary, no `??`).
- The `.ps1` is **pure ASCII** — no em dashes, no box-drawing glyphs
  (`tests/ps-encoding-guard.sh` scans every `.ps1` automatically).
- Install failures are **soft** (warn + `validated=false` + return non-zero),
  never `die` — the marketplace and the closing offer run best-effort.
- Secrets never land in generated files: bake credential-file *paths* into a
  launcher and read them at run time (see `dash_server_write_launcher`).

### 2. Add the versions.json block

```json
"my-tool": {
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "repo": "exasol-labs/my-tool",
  "severity": "normal"
}
```

`repo` for a GitHub-release-installed tool, `package` for a PyPI one — that
field is what the generic upstream lookup (`EXAKIT_VERSION_POLICY=latest`) and
the auto-bump workflow read. Keep the file canonical: `python3 -m json.tool
--indent 2` output, LF-only (CI diffs it).

### 3. Add one registry line each side

`setup/lib/common.sh`, in `exakit_marketplace_addons`:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "my-tool|my-tool (short label)|One-line description shown in the menu and the offer"
```

`setup/lib/exakit-common.ps1`, in `Get-ExakitMarketplaceAddons`:

```powershell
[pscustomobject]@{
    Id          = "my-tool"
    Label       = "my-tool (short label)"
    Description = "One-line description shown in the menu and the offer"
    InstallFn   = "Install-MyTool"
    ValidateFn  = "Test-MyTool"
    UpdateFn    = "Update-MyTool"
    VersionFn   = "Get-MyToolInstalledVersion"
    EnvVar      = "EXAKIT_MY_TOOL_VERSION"
    FallbackVar = "MyToolVersionFallback"
}
```

### The CI guards (same PR, mechanical)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/versions.yml` | Add `"my-tool"` to the `expected = {...}` components set; add an upstream-exists stanza (assert the release tag / PyPI version is real) |
| `.github/workflows/versions-bump.yml` | Add a `COUPLED` entry pointing at the module files' fallback constants; for a GitHub-release tool, add a bump stanza (copy the dash-server one) |

### What you do NOT touch

The registry line is the switch. Menu row, closing-offer row, presence
detection, `exakit update my-tool`, `update all` gating (installed only),
update-check row + discovery line, `exakit version` line,
`EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS` parsing, uninstall sweep of the launcher and the
kit-home state — all generic. `tests/marketplace.sh` asserts `common.sh`
carries **zero** per-add-on case arms, so a regression back to hand-wired
arms fails CI.

---

## Verifying

```bash
bash tests/marketplace.sh        # registry, gating, offer, non-interactive contract
bash tests/dry-run-matrix.sh     # .sh/.ps1 twin parity guards
bash tests/ps-encoding-guard.sh  # the new .ps1 is pure ASCII
bash tests/versions-manifest.sh  # versions.json contract (add your components.my-tool.* paths to the reader-parity list)
bash tests/marketplace-e2e.sh    # sandboxed end-to-end: real install, update flow, uninstall
```

For the new add-on itself, extend `tests/marketplace.sh` sparingly (the
generic layer is already covered — test only what is unique to your module,
e.g. its launcher or validation quirks), and consider a stanza in
`tests/marketplace-e2e.sh` if the tool can prove itself end to end without a
database.

Manual smoke, safely sandboxed:

```bash
EXAKIT_HOME=$(mktemp -d) EXAKIT_BIN_DIR=$(mktemp -d) EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=my-tool bash setup/exakit marketplace
```
