# deploy-progress.sh — proves the two "something is happening" guarantees:
#
#   1. `exasol install local` is no longer echoed to the screen. Its output is
#      consumed into a progress line, while every raw byte still reaches the
#      logfile, the tail survives for a failed deploy, and the launcher's EULA
#      notice is replayed.
#   2. A long, silent step is animated under a truthful label: fetch_quiet keeps
#      the spinner outside the logfile redirect, and an add-on install names
#      itself instead of borrowing the previous step's title.
#
#   bash tests/deploy-progress.sh
#
# Pure logic against a sandboxed kit home: no network, no launcher, no install.
