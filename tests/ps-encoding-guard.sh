# every other .ps1 must be pure ASCII and reference the palette variables.

# This has bitten twice already (an em dash in mcp.ps1, tree connectors in
# exapump.ps1 that made the Windows install fail to parse). Run:

# 4. A NATIVE COMMAND'S stderr IS A TERMINATING ERROR under
# $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop", which both entry points set globally.
#
# `& $python -c "import x" 2>$null` looks like it swallows the noise and lets
# $LASTEXITCODE answer. It does not: Windows PowerShell promotes the native
# command's stderr to a RemoteException BEFORE the exit code can be read. That
# is how `exakit version` and `exakit marketplace` came to die with a bare
# "Traceback (most recent call last):" on any Windows machine carrying a stock
# python without exasol-json-tables - which is the common case, not a corner
# one. Invoke-ExakitLogged has carried the defence and a comment describing the
# quirk for a long time; two probes simply never used it.
#
# The rule: a `&` invocation redirecting stderr must sit inside a window where
# $ErrorActionPreference has been set to "Continue". Checked over the twelve
# preceding lines, which covers the save/set/call/restore shape used
# everywhere in this repo, and a bare try/catch counts too since the
# exception is then handled.
#
# The match is deliberately NOT anchored to the start of the line. It was, and
# that let the commonest shape of all through untouched: `$v = & $python -c ...
# 2>$null`, which is a probe whose whole purpose is to answer a question about
# a possibly-broken thing. Six sites were hiding behind the anchor, among them
# Get-PyexasolInstalledVersion and Get-DashServerPackageVersion (both read by
# `exakit version`) and Test-NanoFirstDeployArgs, where the engine writing
# "No such container" to stderr is the ORDINARY case. Whole-line comments are
# skipped so prose describing the trap does not trip it.
