# Guard `exakit status`: every soft component reports its absence, not one.
#
# exapump, the MCP server and pyexasol all install through exakit_soft_step, so
# any of them can be missing from an install that "finished". The install-time
# report (exakit_print_soft_failures) prints once, from setup-macos.sh /
# setup-wsl.sh, and is long gone by the time anyone types `exakit status`.
#
# The status screen used to hardcode a single pyexasol check. A failed exapump
# was then visible only as an absence from the steps_completed array, which is
# the kind of signal a reader does not notice, while a failed pyexasol got a
# dedicated line with a repair command. Same failure, three treatments.
#
# The trap is that the pyexasol case keeps working while the other two silently
# do not, so a targeted test on pyexasol alone would stay green through the
# whole regression. Each component is therefore checked on its own. Run:
#
#   bash tests/status-soft-components.sh
