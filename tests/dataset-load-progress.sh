# These used to count full blocks with `ui_bar 50 | tr -dc "$UI_BAR_FULL" |
# wc -c | awk '{print $1/3}'`, and it was wrong in a way only Linux showed.
# GNU tr is BYTE-oriented, and the two glyphs share their first two bytes --
# U+2588 is e2 96 88, U+2591 is e2 96 91 -- so a filter meant to keep only
# FULL blocks also kept two bytes out of every EMPTY one. At 50% that is 30
# bytes of full plus 20 bytes of empty, and 50/3 = 16.6667: a count of
# characters came out fractional, which is the tell. BSD tr on macOS treats
# the argument as one multibyte character and drops the empties, so the same
# line passed there and failed only on ubuntu.
#
# The two clamping checks passed everywhere for a reason worth keeping in
# mind: both clamp to a COMPLETELY FULL bar, so there were no empty blocks to
# contaminate the count. The idiom was equally broken in all three; only the
# mixed bar could ever reveal it.
#
# So compare the entire rendered string. No byte arithmetic, no locale, no
# division -- and it asserts the ORDER too (filled first, then remaining),
# which counting never did. bar_glyphs deliberately does not call ui_repeat:
# an expected value must not be built by the code under test.
