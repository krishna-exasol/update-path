# top-level code, so nothing here runs a command or touches the machine. The
# stubs below are defined AFTER this and override the real ones by name, which
# is what keeps the sandbox sealed.
# Top-level functions only. exakit.ps1 declares no class today, but
# exakit-common.ps1 does, and on Windows PowerShell 5.1 a class constructor
# comes back from this walk looking like a function definition - running its
# extent is then a call to a command named after the class, which killed
# tests/skills.ps1 outright before its first check. The same filter here so
# that adding a class to this file is a change, not an outage.
