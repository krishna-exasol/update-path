# setup/lib/runtime-personal.sh. The Exasol Personal launcher can leave an
# orphaned "mac-runner ... __daemon__" process bound to the database port after
# a failed deploy or a destroy that could not find its PID file. The reaper must
# kill exactly that daemon, never a foreign process, and free the port.
