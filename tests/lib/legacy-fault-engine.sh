# legacy-fault-engine.sh — a container engine that misbehaves on request.
#
# Installed into a sandbox as `fakeengine` (the name the fixture manifest
# records as runtime.engine) by tests/legacy-crossing-resilience.sh. It answers
# the three verbs the crossing is allowed to use — inspect, start, stop — and
# takes its behaviour from plain files in $EXAKIT_FAULT_DIR, so a scenario can
# make it hang, refuse, or lose the container between two calls without a
# second stub. Every call is appended to engine.calls, argv verbatim: that log
# is what the suite reads to prove which verbs were ever issued.
#
#   engine.state         running | stopped | absent | unknown | hang | noformat   (running)
#                        (noformat: `inspect -f` fails, plain `inspect` works -
#                        an engine too old for the template flag)
#   engine.start_rc      exit code of `start`                          (0)
#   engine.stop_rc       exit code of `stop`                           (0)
#   engine.hang_seconds  how long `hang` sleeps                        (30)
#
# A successful start or stop UPDATES engine.state, the way a real engine's
# container would change state - so a scenario that starts a stopped
# container sees it running on the next inspect.
