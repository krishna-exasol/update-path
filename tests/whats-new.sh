# Guard setup/whats-new.json: the cards are authored by hand, so the file is
# checked here rather than discovered broken by a user mid-upgrade.
#
# The card renderer truncates an over-long line to "..." and caps the number of
# lines per version. Both are last-resort safety nets, not a licence to write
# long lines: a reader who upgrades sees half a sentence and no way to get the
# rest except a second command. Before this test existed the shipped 0.2.0 notes
# were changelog prose, and EVERY line in the box was cut mid-word.
#
# Also checks the things a hand-edited JSON file gets wrong: a stray comma, a
# version key that is not a dotted number (it would be silently skipped, so the
# release ships with no card at all), and a value that is not a list of strings.
