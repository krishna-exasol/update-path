# Guard the group-parent checkbox: a parent row must never claim more than is
# selected.
#
# The checkbox widget's group parent has two modes (see the spec comment on
# _ui_checkbox_apply_group in common.sh): "any" leaves the parent checked while
# ANY child is checked, "all" checks it only while EVERY child is. Every menu
# whose parent row reads as a select-all summary ("Available add-ons", "Sample
# datasets") must use "all". Under "any" a menu with one of three children
# ticked renders
#
#     [x] Available add-ons
#     [ ] |- dash-server ...
#     [ ] |- exasol-vscode ...
#     [x] `- json-tables ...
#
# and the summary row says "everything" on the exact line a user reads to
# confirm what is about to be installed or loaded.
#
# The spec is a bare string built at the call site, so a refactor can drop the
# 4th field and silently fall back to "any" with nothing failing. This checks
# the behaviour, not just the strings. Run:
#
#   bash tests/checkbox-group.sh
