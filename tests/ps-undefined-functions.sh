#
# PowerShell resolves command names at call time, not at parse time, so a
# script that invokes Read-ExakitCredential parses clean, passes every
# brace-balance guard, and dies with CommandNotFoundException on the first
# Windows machine that reaches the line. That is exactly how the
# exasol-scheduler install shipped broken on Windows while CI stayed green:
# three call sites named functions defined nowhere in the repo.
#
# This suite parses every .ps1 that SHIPS TO USERS (setup/** plus the
# top-level installers) into its AST and checks each static
# Verb-Noun invocation against the set of functions defined anywhere in the
# repo plus the commands resolvable in this pwsh. Windows-only cmdlets that a
# Linux/macOS pwsh cannot see are allowlisted by name — the point is catching
# names that exist NOWHERE, not names that exist only on Windows.
