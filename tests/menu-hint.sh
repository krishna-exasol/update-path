# Guard the checkbox menu's keyboard hint: it must describe what the keys do.
#
# On an either/or menu - exactly two selectable rows, one of them exclusive -
# Space does not toggle anything a reader would call a toggle. It moves the tick
# from one answer to the other, which is choosing. The kit asks two such
# questions (the marketplace offer, the JSON Tables offer) and both said
# "Space to toggle", inviting the reader to switch both answers off (Enter then
# silently refuses, because a selection is required) or to read two answers to
# one question as two independent switches.
#
# A real multi-select keeps "toggle" - that IS what Space does there - so this
# checks BOTH shapes. A fix that said "select" everywhere would be just as wrong
# in the other direction, and a test that only looked at the either/or menu
# would not notice.
#
# The verb is derived from the menu's shape, not set per call site, so this also
# pins that behaviour: a new either/or menu must get it without anyone
# remembering to ask. Run:
#
#   bash tests/menu-hint.sh
