# data-load-shapes-ps.ps1 - behavioural tests for the Windows twin of the local
# data loader on the files people actually have: Windows line endings, a
# byte-order mark, ';'-separated German exports, a GTFS feed of .txt files, a
# header with no rows, a .geojson. Twin of the "real-world CSV shapes" section
# of tests/bulk-folder-load.sh.
#
# THE KIT IS A BRIDGE. It hands files to exapump and says what exapump says
# back; it does not rewrite them. That is measured at the binary's argv and at
# the bytes it receives: the ORIGINAL path, the ORIGINAL bytes (CR and BOM
# included), exapump's own --delimiter when the header calls for it, no upload
# at all for a file with nothing in it or a name exapump refuses by extension,
# and a failure reason that names the cause the inspector saw.
