# marketplace-e2e.sh — end-to-end proof of the marketplace add-on flow, against
# a SANDBOXED kit home (the real ~/.exasol-starter-kit is never touched):
#
#   1. `exakit marketplace` (non-interactive, EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS)
#      installs dash-server from its real GitHub release into a kit-managed
#      venv, writes the launcher, and validates the HTTP control plane.
#   2. The installed add-on joins the update flow: `exakit version` lists it,
#      `exakit update dash-server` answers "already current", `exakit version`
#      reports it, and a second marketplace run offers nothing to install.
#   3. `exakit_uninstall_run` sweeps the venv, state and launcher.
#
# Needs the network (GitHub + PyPI) and uv; SKIPs cleanly when either is
# missing so it is safe in a dry CI environment. No database is required:
# dash-server starts and answers /mcp without a bootstrapped profile.
