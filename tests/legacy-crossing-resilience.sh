# legacy-crossing-resilience.sh — the crossing from a container database onto
# Exasol Personal, under every fault the road can throw at it.
#
#   bash tests/legacy-crossing-resilience.sh
#
# tests/legacy-crossing.sh pins WHAT the crossing decides. This suite pins what
# it does when the things it depends on misbehave: an engine that hangs,
# refuses, or loses the container between two calls; a database that has no
# password on file, never answers, answers late, or has nothing in it; a copy
# that fails for some tables, or all of them, or cannot even make its
# directory; a restore that finds files missing, tables taken, uploads
# refused; a run that dies between the two halves and comes back. In every one
# of those the install must go on, nothing of the user's may be destroyed, the
# question must be asked at most once, and the manifest must tell the truth.
#
# Both stubs are fault-injection programs in tests/lib/, driven by plain files
# in a per-scenario control directory - one engine, one exapump, no per-test
# rewrites. The engine is named `fakeengine`, which exists nowhere but the
# sandbox; exapump is reached through EXAKIT_EXAPUMP_BIN AND PATH, so no fix in
# the kit is the only thing between this suite and a real database.
#
# Every run is traced, and the suite ends by measuring how much of
# setup/lib/legacy-crossing.sh it walked. The floor is a gate, not a note.
