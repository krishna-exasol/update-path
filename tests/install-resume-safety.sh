# Guard the ways an installer run can undo - or fail to explain - what the user
# already had.
#
# The first two are resume-path bugs: the first run is fine, and the damage only
# appears on the second run, which is the run nobody tests by hand. The Windows
# findings after them have the same shape: not one of them shows up on a first
# install, on the machine the developer happens to be sitting at.
#
#   1. A resumed runtime step leaves its destroy/volume-rm armed. mark_step is
#      the only thing that clears the rollback stack, and a resume branch has no
#      mark_step to make -- the step is already recorded as done. So the undo
#      registered by the redeploy stays armed for the rest of the run, and any
#      later die offers to run it under a prompt that calls it "the failed
#      step's changes".
#
#   2. The installer overwrites a recorded `exakit autostart off`. An
#      unconditional exakit_autostart_enable wrote autostart.enabled=true before
#      exakit_autostart_default_on -- the function whose whole job is to leave a
#      recorded answer alone -- ever looked at it.
#
#   3. The Windows installer replaces a named failure with a number. install.ps1
#      re-threw the setup script's exit code, so its trap printed "Setup failed
#      with exit code 1" over the cause and remedy the setup script had just
#      named, and then blamed the network for it.
#
#   4. The Windows installer writes to the machine before it checks it: the
#      download, the replaced kit directory and the setup script's logfile all
#      landed before a single requirement was looked at.
#
#   5. A failed re-install destroys the working kit: the old copy was deleted
#      before the replacement existed, and the installed exakit shim points
#      into it by absolute path.
#
#   6. Windows-on-ARM skips two steps without printing them - the step counter
#      jumps 1/5 to 4/5 - and then offers to connect AI clients to the bridge
#      it just skipped.
