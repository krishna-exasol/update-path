## What is this?

You already use AI. The hard part is trusting it with your data. This kit gives you a complete, private AI-ready analytics setup that runs **entirely on your machine**. See every SQL statement before it runs, verify every answer yourself, and rerun the whole thing tomorrow.

**One command installs four things and connects them:**

| | Component | What it does for you |
|---|---|---|
| 🤖 | **[MCP server](https://github.com/exasol/mcp-server)** | Lets Claude, Cursor, or other supported MCP clients query your database with a dedicated read-only login |
| 🗄️ | **[Exasol&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;Local](https://github.com/exasol/exasol-personal)** | A full in-memory analytics database, running locally |
| ⚡ | **[exapump](https://github.com/exasol-labs/exapump)** | Load CSV/Parquet files and run SQL from your terminal |
| 🐍 | **[pyexasol](https://github.com/exasol/pyexasol)** | The official Exasol Python driver, ready in its own environment |

**Four add-ons — add them any time with `exakit marketplace`:**

| | Add-on | What it does for you |
|---|---|---|
| 📊 | **[dash-server](https://github.com/exasol-labs/dash-server)** | Your AI builds live, query-backed dashboards on the local database; you open them in the browser |
| 🧩 | **[Exasol&nbsp;for&nbsp;VS&nbsp;Code](https://github.com/exasol-labs/exasol-vscode)** | SQL editing and schema browsing against the local database, inside your editor |
| 🧬 | **[JSON&nbsp;Tables](https://github.com/exasol-labs/exasol-json-tables)** | Load JSON files into Exasol as regular tables, nested documents included |
| ⏱️ | **[Exasol&nbsp;Scheduler](https://github.com/exasol-labs/exasol-scheduler)** | Lightweight, table-driven SQL job scheduling: run SQL on a timetable inside the local database |



## Key features

- 🪶 **Almost no prerequisites.** No Homebrew, Rust or Python install needed. The kit uses a suitable Python if it finds one, otherwise it installs a managed one for itself.
- ⚡ **Database up in under 2 minutes.** The full install — sample data and AI client setup included — takes longer, notably so on Windows. Let it finish; re-running is always safe.
- 🔒 **Read-only AI.** Your assistant can read everything and change nothing. The database enforces it.
- 🤖 **Support for multiple AI clients.** Claude, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Continue.
- 📊 **Sample data included.** Three sample datasets, loaded and verified for you.
- ♻️ **Safe to re-run.** Re-runs skip what is already done.

## 🚀 Local Agent-Ready Starter

*Install, connect an AI assistant, ask your first question.*

### Will it run on my machine?

| Your machine | Minimum Requirements | That's all |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | 8 GB+ RAM, 20 GB free disk | The database runs natively |
| **Linux / WSL** | Docker or Podman (running), 4 GB+ RAM | Container runtime required |
| **Windows** | Docker Desktop (running), 4 GB+ RAM | Native Windows uses the PowerShell installer |

**No Python install needed** on any platform: the kit uses a system Python 3.11+ when it finds one, and otherwise installs a managed Python for its own use.

Step-by-step guides: [QUICKSTART](QUICKSTART.md) · [macOS](quickstarts/macos.md) · [WSL](quickstarts/windows-wsl.md) · [Windows + Docker](quickstarts/windows-docker.md)

### Installing: what to expect

One command does the whole install. It checks your machine, shows what it will do, and then installs the database, exapump, the MCP server, pyexasol and your AI client connections. The database is ready in about two minutes. The rest takes a few minutes more, especially on Windows. Let it finish. It is the same on macOS, Linux, WSL and Windows PowerShell.

At the end you get a connection panel with everything you need, and a first prompt for your AI client is on your clipboard.

Installing from a script or an AI agent? See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Connect your AI assistant

```bash
exakit mcp-setup
```

A checkbox multi-select (↑/↓ to move, **Space** to toggle, **Enter** to confirm) over **Claude**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Gemini CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Continue**, and **Skip for now**. The list is **dynamic**: clients already connected, or not installed on this machine, aren't offered. If everything found is already connected, the command says so and exits.

The command checks the MCP connection, prints where each config lives, and gives you a first prompt to try. It writes the exact path of the local MCP launcher into the client configs, so setup does not depend on what is on each app's PATH.

The installer runs this step for you automatically. `exakit mcp-setup` re-runs it any time.

Health check any time: `exakit mcp-doctor`.

## Let an AI assistant drive the kit (the skills)

The installer gives your AI agent seven skills, one per thing it may need to drive: setup, the database, exapump, MCP, Python, the Exasol tool ecosystem and the marketplace, plus one per installed add-on. They work in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any tool that reads the open skill standard, and load only when relevant. `exakit skills` lists them, `exakit update` refreshes them. Index: [skills/README.md](skills/README.md).

## The workflow this kit teaches

```
ASK -> INSPECT -> RUN -> VALIDATE -> RERUN
```

Ask your assistant: *"Which product category generated the most revenue? Show me the SQL before you run it."*

## Sample data included

The kit ships **three bundled datasets**, each in its own schema, so your AI client sees them instantly:

| Dataset | What it is | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| **TPC-H retail** | The standard wholesale/retail model: customers, orders, line items, parts, suppliers (~175k rows, ~21 MB) ([data/datasets/tpch](data/datasets/tpch)) | `TPCH` |
| **Smart&#8209;meter&nbsp;energy&nbsp;readings** | A ~108k-row time series ([data/datasets/energy](data/datasets/energy)) | `ENERGY` |
| **Daily&nbsp;city&nbsp;weather&nbsp;history** | ~11k rows ([data/datasets/weather](data/datasets/weather)) | `WEATHER` |

```bash
exakit data-load             # bundled datasets not yet loaded, or your own data
exakit data-load --force     # reload the bundled datasets
```

Your own data can be CSV, Parquet or JSON files, or a folder of them, one table each (JSON through the JSON Tables add-on, offered when needed). Uploads land in the `STARTER_KIT` schema. Details: [what's included](data/README.md) · [data dictionary](data/data-dictionary.md) · [14 example questions with reference SQL](data/example-questions.md)

## More ways to connect

- **GUI**: [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) or [DbVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/download/). New Connection, Exasol, host `127.0.0.1`, port `8563`, user `sys`.
  - `exakit info` shows where the password lives.
- **Python**: pyexasol comes preinstalled in its own environment.
- **Terminal**: `exapump interactive -p starter-kit` opens a SQL shell.

Run `exakit guide` for the full walkthrough.

## Everyday commands

```bash
exakit status          # is everything running?
exakit info            # connection details
exakit start           # start the database
exakit stop            # stop it (your data is kept)
exakit data-load       # load more data
exakit mcp-setup       # connect AI clients
exakit mcp-doctor      # AI connection health check
exakit version         # what is installed, and what is newer
exakit update          # apply the quick ones (seconds, no downtime)
exakit marketplace     # optional add-ons (dashboards & more)
exakit help            # every command
```

Something failed mid-install? Re-run the install command. It picks up where it left off.

## Add-ons: the marketplace

The install stays minimal on purpose; extras live in the marketplace. At the
end of a successful install the kit asks once whether to add any — or browse
later with:

```bash
exakit marketplace
```

Space selects, Enter installs. Installed add-ons update through `exakit update`
like everything else, and a tool you already have — even one installed outside
the kit — is never offered twice. Flowcharts of every scenario, and how to
build your own add-on: [MARKETPLACE.md](MARKETPLACE.md).

## Staying up to date

The maintainers publish one **tested set** of versions, `versions.json` on the
kit repository's `main` branch: the kit scripts, the database runtime, exapump,
the MCP server, pyexasol, the agent skills and every add-on. Your machine reads
that file (refreshed at most once a day, cached for offline use) and compares it
with what is installed. An update therefore means "move to the combination the
maintainers verified together", never "hope independent releases work with each
other".

```bash
exakit version           # one row per component: installed, advertised, status
exakit version --json    # the same as one object
exakit update            # apply everything that is pending
```

What `exakit update` does, in order:

1. **The kit itself.** When a newer kit version is advertised, it downloads the
   kit repository's `main` archive, replaces the kit scripts, keeps the previous
   copy beside them (`~/.exasol-starter-kit/kit.backup-<timestamp>`), refreshes
   the agent skills and shows a "What's new" card for every version you crossed.
   Database data, credentials and MCP client configs are not touched.
2. **The database runtime.** This one stops the database for a minute or two, so
   it **asks first**, and in a script, a pipe or CI, where nobody can answer, it is
   never started on its own. Opt in with `exakit update --yes` (or
   `EXAKIT_CONFIRM_RUNTIME_UPDATE=1`). Your data is kept: the update reuses the
   same data volume, and the previous version is put back if the new one does not
   come up.
3. **exapump, the MCP server, pyexasol** in seconds, digest-verified, no downtime.
4. **The agent skills.** The skill set has its own version. When the maintainers
   bump it, `exakit update` fetches the new set from `main` and places it, no kit
   release needed.
5. **Installed add-ons**, each through its own module.

Anything already current is skipped; "Everything is already current" means
exactly that.

A few things worth knowing:

- **You are told, quietly.** When a pending update is `recommended` or `critical`,
  one dim line appears after another command, at most once a day. `normal`
  updates never interrupt. `EXAKIT_NO_UPDATE_NOTICE=1` turns the line off.
- **The kit never moves a component backwards.** If a release is withdrawn and
  the tested version goes down, a machine already on the higher one shows both
  numbers and nothing changes.
- **Offline is fine.** Version resolution falls back to the cached copy, then to
  the copy that shipped with your kit. No command fails because the update check
  could not reach the network.
- **Fresh installs always get the tested set**, because the installer reads the
  same file. `EXAKIT_VERSION_POLICY=latest` resolves each component from its own
  upstream instead; `pinned` uses the kit's built-in fallbacks and touches no
  network. `EXAKIT_VERSIONS_URL` points at a different `versions.json`.

## Safety and operations

- **Dedicated read-only MCP login.** The kit provisions and validates a least-privilege database user before any MCP flow proceeds.
- **Local TLS handled for MCP clients.** Generated MCP client configs set `EXA_SSL_CERT_VALIDATION=no` only for the local self-signed `127.0.0.1` runtime. Use trusted CA validation for real remote databases.
- **No preinstalled Python required.** Uses `python3` when present, otherwise bootstraps a managed runtime through `uv`.
- **Repo stays pure source.** Runtime state, logs, credentials, backups, and generated configs live under `~/.exasol-starter-kit/`, never in this repo.
- **Everything is inspectable.** Install scripts, MCP configs, backups, and logs remain available on disk.
- **Local only.** The database listens on `127.0.0.1` only, passwords live in local files and are never shown on screen, and AI client configs are backed up before every change.
- **Reversible lifecycle.** `exakit` manages the kit end to end: `status`, `start`/`stop`, `data-load`, MCP setup and maintenance (`mcp-setup`, `mcp-doctor`), `logs`, and a guarded `uninstall`. Run `exakit help` (or `exakit catalog`) to see every command.

## Quick answers

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;need&nbsp;Rust&nbsp;/&nbsp;Python&nbsp;/&nbsp;Homebrew? | **None of them.** The kit uses a system Python 3.11+ if you have one, and otherwise installs a managed Python for its own use. |
| Does&nbsp;it&nbsp;cost&nbsp;anything? | No. Exasol Personal Local is free. |
| What&nbsp;makes&nbsp;this&nbsp;"for&nbsp;Agentic&nbsp;AI"? | An MCP server ships in the box with a dedicated read-only login, so Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients can query your data directly, with every SQL statement inspectable before it runs. |
| What&nbsp;sample&nbsp;data&nbsp;is&nbsp;included? | Three bundled datasets: TPC-H retail, smart-meter energy, daily weather, each in its own schema. See the [data dictionary](data/data-dictionary.md). |
| Can&nbsp;I&nbsp;load&nbsp;my&nbsp;own&nbsp;data? | Yes. `exakit data-load` has a local CSV or Parquet option, and `exapump upload` works from the terminal. |
| Docker&nbsp;installed&nbsp;but&nbsp;not&nbsp;running? | Start Docker Desktop, run the install command again. |
| Docker Desktop runs on Windows<br>but WSL can't see it? | Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → **WSL integration** → enable your distro → Apply & restart (the installer detects and flags this too). |
| `exakit` not recognized after<br>a Windows install? | Re-run the install command. It adds `~\.local\bin` to your user PATH and repairs the command automatically. |
| Port&nbsp;8563&nbsp;already&nbsp;taken? | `EXAKIT_DB_PORT=8564` before the install command. |
| Behind&nbsp;a&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;proxy? | `export HTTPS_PROXY=...` and re-run. |
| Where's&nbsp;the&nbsp;deep-dive&nbsp;for&nbsp;my&nbsp;OS? | [macOS](quickstarts/macos.md) · [WSL](quickstarts/windows-wsl.md) · [Windows + Docker](quickstarts/windows-docker.md) |
| Installing&nbsp;over&nbsp;a&nbsp;database<br>I&nbsp;already&nbsp;have? | **It is adopted, not replaced.** A running database is reused (the installer asks, and defaults to yes); a stopped one is started and reused. Your data is untouched. Only a database that cannot start at all is replaced, and the installer says so first — including that the previous data is not recoverable. |
| How&nbsp;do&nbsp;updates&nbsp;work? | The maintainers publish one tested set of versions. `exakit version` shows what is pending; `exakit update` applies it. See [Staying up to date](#staying-up-to-date). |
| How&nbsp;do&nbsp;I&nbsp;remove&nbsp;everything? | `exakit uninstall` |
