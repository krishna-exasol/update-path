# Tasks

Status: Phase 4 approved baseline for Phase 5 API design.

## Tasking Goals

- Convert the approved design into an execution-ready backlog
- Preserve strict dependency ordering
- Enable component-by-component implementation
- Keep testing and validation embedded in the work, not deferred to the end

## Rules

- Tasks must map back to approved design.
- No task may imply architecture not already documented.
- No implementation starts until Phase 5 API design is approved.
- Each implementation workstream must include validation and test tasks.

## Workstream Overview

The backlog is organized into nine workstreams:

1. foundation and repository scaffolding
2. core contracts and result model
3. runtime and manifest management
4. adapter framework
5. validation and security controls
6. operation orchestration
7. diagnostics and reporting
8. integration and cross-platform hardening
9. release-readiness and documentation finish

## Dependency Order

```text
Foundation
  -> Core contracts
    -> Runtime + Adapter framework
      -> Validation + Security
        -> Operation orchestration
          -> Diagnostics
            -> Integration hardening
              -> Release readiness
```

## Suggested Implementation Sequence After Approval

When implementation eventually begins, use this order:

1. repository scaffolding and shared abstractions
2. core contracts and error model
3. manifest and snapshot repository
4. adapter registry and one reference adapter
5. validation and security policies
6. configure and validate orchestration
7. repair, backup, restore, and uninstall orchestration
8. diagnostics and status reporting
9. additional client adapters

## Critical Open Questions Before Implementation

- Which upstream component owns credential resolution?
- Which target clients support full managed ownership versus patch-only behavior?
- What exact non-destructive Exasol validation query or probe should be standardized?
- Should uninstall archive the manifest or delete it after final backup?

## Definition Of Ready For Phase 5

- All major workstreams have explicit task coverage.
- Dependencies are clear enough to sequence work safely.
- Test-first requirements are attached to each major workstream.
- Remaining ambiguities are surfaced as questions, not hidden in tasks.

## Production-Hardening Review Scorecard

Captured on 2026-07-07 from the implementation review that triggered the hardening pass.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Standards | 6/10 | Useful update flow, but upgrade mutation paths do not fully match documented backup/plan expectations. |
| Spec Fit | N/A | No originating issue, PRD, or spec file was found. Review compared against repo docs and README promises. |
| Correctness Risk | 7/10 | Unix update path is mostly coherent; Windows parity is the biggest risk. |
| Test Coverage | 7/10 | `tests/dry-run-matrix.sh` covered key routing and passed 29/29. Python tests could not run because `pytest` was not installed. |
| Architecture | 6.5/10 | Current architecture is workable, but update/state ownership is spreading across Bash, PowerShell, and Python. |
| Maintainability | 6/10 | Component routing and version lookup are becoming repeated string-switch logic. |
| Cross-Platform Parity | 5.5/10 | Unix install resolves latest versions by default, but Windows shared setup still uses pinned defaults. |
| Safety / Recovery | 6/10 | Personal major upgrades have a safer plan/backup/apply path; the MCP update flow needs clearer snapshot/backup behavior. |
| Documentation Alignment | 7/10 | README documents the new capability, but previously overstated "latest by default" for Windows. |
| Overall | 6.5/10 | Good direction, but update safety and platform parity need tightening before production-solid status. |

## Production-Hardening Backlog

Target bar: move each scored category to 9/10 or better by making promises executable, tested, and documented.

### PH-001 Cross-platform latest-version install parity

Status: done in the 2026-07-07 hardening pass.

Tasks:

- Move Windows setup to the same policy as Unix: `EXAKIT_VERSION_POLICY=latest` by default, explicit env overrides when supplied, last-known-good fallbacks only when lookup fails.
- Record resolved desired versions in the manifest before component installation.
- Add dry-run/static guards that fail if Windows setup drifts back to pinned-only defaults.

Acceptance:

- Windows setup resolves latest launcher, exapump, and MCP versions before first install.
- Fallback mode remains deterministic for offline/corporate-proxy environments.
- `tests/dry-run-matrix.sh` covers the behavior.

### PH-002 Runtime update recovery

Status: superseded. The container runtime this item was written for no longer
exists; Exasol Personal is the kit's only runtime.

What replaced it:

- A minor launcher update replaces the launcher and leaves the deployment's data untouched, so there is no image to restore.
- A MAJOR upgrade is a data migration and keeps its own explicit plan/backup/apply flow, with a real archive under `~/.exasol-starter-kit/backups/`.
- Both halves probe the database after the update instead of recording it healthy on faith.

### PH-003 MCP update snapshot clarity

Status: done in the 2026-07-07 hardening pass.

Tasks:

- Run a managed MCP backup before refreshing the MCP package/config bundle when the runtime operation layer is available.
- Surface the snapshot reference in command output and store it at `backups.mcp_update.latest` in the manifest.
- Keep the snapshot best-effort because package refresh does not directly rewrite permanent client configs.

Acceptance:

- MCP update no longer hides whether a snapshot was attempted.
- Managed client mutations remain owned by the Python runtime operation layer.
- Tests guard the Bash and PowerShell wrappers.

### PH-004 Documentation truthfulness and operator guidance

Status: done in the 2026-07-07 hardening pass.

Tasks:

- Document the production-hardening contract in `mcp/docs/production-hardening.md`.
- Update operations and risk docs with version-resolution and update-recovery expectations.
- Keep README promises aligned with the implemented safety model.

Acceptance:

- The docs distinguish full database-data backups from runtime/client-config snapshots.
- The docs explain which update paths are blocking, best-effort, or manual.
- Future reviewers can map README claims to code paths and tests.

### PH-005 Remaining score uplift gates

Status: pending.

Tasks:

- Run Python unit tests once `pytest` is available.
- Add deeper PowerShell behavior tests on a Windows runner or CI job.
- Consider extracting repeated component-version lookup logic if another component is added.

Acceptance:

- Python unit tests pass in addition to shell dry-run coverage.
- Windows install/update behavior is validated on native Windows, not only parsed and statically guarded from macOS.
- No new component update path bypasses manifest recording and recovery notes.
