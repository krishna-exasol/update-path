# install.ps1 - Exasol Personal Local Starter Kit, one-command installer (Windows).
#
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krishna-exasol/update-path/main/install.ps1 | iex
#
# IMPORTANT: this file must NOT have a UTF-8 BOM. It is only ever executed
# via `irm | iex` (as a fetched string, never read from disk with -File), and
# a BOM that survives into that string as a literal U+FEFF character breaks
# PowerShell's '#' comment-line detection - the parser then tries to execute
# the comment text itself as commands. (setup\setup-windows-docker.ps1 and
# setup\exakit.ps1 are the opposite case: always read from disk via -File,
# where a BOM is the correct fix for a different, real encoding bug - do not
# "fix" those to match this file.)
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. checks this machine can run the kit (container runtime, memory, free
#      disk) - before anything at all is written
#   2. downloads the starter kit to ~\.exasol-starter-kit\kit (so you can
#      read every script before or after it runs)
#   3. shows the installation plan
#   4. hands off to setup\setup-windows-docker.ps1, which installs the
#      Exasol Nano database container, exapump (data loading CLI), and the
#      MCP server - the same components the macOS/Linux/WSL path installs

# the machine is still untouched - a laptop that was never going to pass was
# still left with a rewritten kit directory and an install log to explain.

# matter because Docker Desktop adds its bin directory to the MACHINE PATH at
