# install.ps1 - Exasol Personal Local Starter Kit, one-command installer (Windows).
#
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exasol-labs/exasol-personal-local-starterkit/main/install.ps1 | iex
#
# IMPORTANT: this file must NOT have a UTF-8 BOM. It is only ever executed
# via `irm | iex` (as a fetched string, never read from disk with -File), and
# a BOM that survives into that string as a literal U+FEFF character breaks
# PowerShell's '#' comment-line detection - the parser then tries to execute
# the comment text itself as commands. (setup\setup-windows-docker.ps1 and
# setup\exakit.ps1 are the opposite case: always read from disk via -File,
# where a BOM is the correct fix for a different, real encoding bug - do not
# "fix" those to match this file.)
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. detects your hardware and container runtime
#   2. downloads the starter kit to ~\.exasol-starter-kit\kit (so you can
#      read every script before or after it runs)
#   3. shows the installation plan
#   4. hands off to setup\setup-windows-docker.ps1, which installs the
#      Exasol Nano database container, exapump (data loading CLI), and the
#      MCP server - the same components the macOS/Linux/WSL path installs
#
# Options (environment variables):
#   $env:EXAKIT_DRY_RUN = "1"   show the plan, install nothing
#   $env:EXAKIT_REPO    = "..." override the source repo (owner/name)
#   $env:EXAKIT_REF     = "..." override the git ref to install from

#                               anything else = built-in fallbacks, no network
#   $env:EXAKIT_VERSIONS_URL = "..."  where that document is fetched from
