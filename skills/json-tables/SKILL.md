# JSON Tables — JSON into Exasol

`json-tables` is a **marketplace add-on** that ingests, queries and reshapes
JSON-shaped data, shredding a nested tree into relational tables the database
can actually work with.

## Why it exists

`exapump upload` loads **CSV and Parquet**. It does not load JSON, and that is
not an oversight — JSON is a nested tree, not a table, so something has to
decide how the nesting becomes rows and columns. That is this add-on's job.

## The easy path — let the data load offer it

You usually do not install this by hand. Hand `exakit data-load` a `.json`
file and the kit explains the gap and offers the add-on **on the spot**, then
continues the load automatically once it is installed:

```bash
exakit data-load
```

Driving that non-interactively, answer with the marketplace variable:

```bash
EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=json-tables exakit data-load
```

| Value | Effect at the JSON prompt |
|---|---|
| `json-tables` or `all` | install it and continue the load |
| `none` | do not install; the file is **not** loaded |
| unset | interactive prompt; a non-TTY run does not load the file |

If the add-on is not available on this machine at all, the kit says so and
notes that CSV and Parquet still load without it — convert the file, or load it
from a supported machine.

## Installing it directly

```bash
EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=json-tables exakit marketplace
```

## Using it

```bash
exasol-json-tables --help
exasol-json-tables ingest --input <file.json>
```

The launcher is installed on `PATH` by the kit. Run `--help` before composing
a command — read the real flags rather than guessing them.

## No Rust toolchain, ever

This is the fact users most need reassuring about. Upstream, the tool is a
Python package **plus a Rust ingest engine**, and the published wheel does not
contain the engine — so a plain `pip install` cannot ingest even on a machine
that *has* Rust.

The kit solves that for the user: the engine binaries are **built once per
platform by the kit's own packaging workflow**, published to a mirror release,
and downloaded **digest-verified** at install time. Nothing is compiled on the
user's machine and no Rust toolchain is required.

To make the upstream CLI use that prebuilt engine, the kit places a small
`cargo` shim in front of it. **That shim is visible only to processes the kit's
launcher starts** — the user's real `cargo`, if they have one, is untouched
everywhere else. Do not "clean up" the shim; it is load-bearing.

A consequence worth knowing: what is *installable* here is what the kit's
packaging workflow has published, not whatever upstream tagged most recently.
So a version you see upstream may legitimately not be offered yet.

## Managing it

```bash
exakit version                   # its row shows installed vs advertised
exakit update json-tables        # also the repair command
exakit logs json-tables
exakit uninstall                 # selectable on its own
```

## When it fails

| Symptom | Do |
|---|---|
| The add-on is not offered at all | it is already installed, or not applicable on this machine — check `exakit marketplace` output for the reason |
| Ingest errors | `exakit logs json-tables`, then `exakit update json-tables` to repair |
| `exasol-json-tables: command not found` | it is not installed — `EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=json-tables exakit marketplace` |
| A JSON load did nothing | the prompt was answered `none`, or the run had no TTY and no `EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS` |

## Guardrails

- **Never tell the user to install Rust** to make this work. If ingest fails,
  the fix is `exakit update json-tables`, not a toolchain.
- **Do not bypass the kit's launcher** to run the upstream CLI directly — the
  `cargo` shim it sets up is what lets the CLI find the prebuilt engine.
- **Loading data writes to the database.** Confirm the target schema and table
  with the user first; uploads default to the `STARTER_KIT` schema.
- **Do not invent** `exasol-json-tables` subcommands or flags. Run `--help`.
