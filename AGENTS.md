# Agent guide: Exasol Personal Local Starter Kit

This repo installs a complete local analytics stack with one command: an Exasol database on the user's machine, the `exapump` data/SQL CLI, an MCP server with a dedicated read-only database user, and the `pyexasol` Python driver. If a user asks you to "install this repo", this file is your runbook.

## Install (one command)

macOS / Linux / WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krishna-exasol/update-path/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krishna-exasol/update-path/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer is **fully unattended-safe**. With no TTY attached (the normal case for an agent shell) every question takes a safe default: all bundled datasets are loaded, and every AI client that is installed on the machine but not yet connected gets an MCP config. Nothing ever hangs waiting for input.

One caveat when driving a **WSL** install from the Windows side (`wsl.exe -- bash -c "curl ... | sh"`): wsl.exe can attach a console that looks interactive but never delivers keypresses, so menus render and block. Either run the command detached (`setsid sh -c '...' < /dev/null`) or pre-answer everything with the env vars below.

## Answer the install's choices via environment variables

Flags do not travel through a pipe, so choices are env vars. They work on all platforms; on Windows set them with `$env:` before `irm ... | iex`. **Always use client and dataset names, never menu numbers.** Numbers are display order and change between releases.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `EXAKIT_MCP_CLIENTS=claude,cursor` | Which MCP clients to configure, by name: `claude` (= desktop app **and** Claude Code CLI), `claude_desktop`, `claude_code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `vscode_copilot` (also `copilot`), `gemini_cli` (also `gemini`), `opencode`, `continue`, `all`, `skip` |
| `EXAKIT_SKIP_MCP=1` | Skip MCP client setup entirely (run `exakit mcp-setup` later) |
| `EXAKIT_DATASETS=tpch,weather` | Which bundled datasets to load, by id: `tpch`, `energy`, `weather`. Takes precedence over `EXAKIT_LOAD_SAMPLE` |
| `EXAKIT_LOAD_SAMPLE=0\|1` | `0` skip data loading, `1` load the bundled sample (tpch) |
| `EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=dash-server` | Answer the closing marketplace offer: ids csv, `all`, or `none`. Unset, a non-interactive install skips the offer with a hint |
| `EXAKIT_REUSE_DB=0\|1` | macOS: adopt an existing database (`1`, the default) or destroy it and deploy fresh (`0`) |
| `EXAKIT_PREFLIGHT=1` | Check machine requirements only, installs nothing (sh installer only) |
| `EXAKIT_DRY_RUN=1` | Download the kit for inspection, installs nothing |
| `EXAKIT_DB_PORT=8564` | Alternate DB port (Linux and Windows container path only) |

Version and update behaviour (all optional, sensible defaults):

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `EXAKIT_VERSION_POLICY=manifest\|latest\|pinned` | Where versions come from. `manifest` (default) installs the tested set the maintainers publish in `versions.json`; `latest` resolves each component from its own upstream; anything else (`pinned`) uses the kit's built-in fallbacks and touches no network |
| `EXAKIT_VERSIONS_URL=...` | Where that document is fetched from (must be `https://`). Defaults to the kit repository's `versions.json` on `main` |
| `EXAKIT_VERSIONS_TTL=86400` | Seconds before the cached copy is refreshed. `0` fetches every time |
| `EXAKIT_<COMPONENT>_VERSION=...` | Pin one component by hand: `EXAKIT_EXAPUMP_VERSION`, `EXAKIT_MCP_VERSION`, `EXAKIT_PYEXASOL_VERSION`, `EXAKIT_PERSONAL_VERSION`, `EXAKIT_NANO_TAG`. Outranks the manifest, on install **and** on update |
| `EXAKIT_CONFIRM_RUNTIME_UPDATE=1` | Pre-answer "yes, you may stop the database and recreate the container". Covers both entry points: it skips the confirmation in `exakit update runtime`, and it opts an unattended `exakit update` into the runtime change it would otherwise defer (`exakit update --yes` does the same for one run). `=0` is a deliberate "no" and outranks the prompt |
| `EXAKIT_NO_UPDATE_NOTICE=1` | Never print the once-a-day update notice after other commands |

Example:

```bash
curl -fsSL .../install.sh | EXAKIT_MCP_CLIENTS=claude EXAKIT_DATASETS=tpch sh
```

## Timing: read this before you run it

- The first install deploys a database, **usually in under 2 minutes** on every platform.
- Your shell tool may **time out before the deploy finishes**. That is not a failure. Run the install in the background (or with a raised timeout), then poll:

```bash
exakit status        # until it reports running
```

- **Re-running the installer is safe and resumes.** Completed steps are skipped, failed steps retry. When in doubt, re-run rather than diagnose.
- An existing database is **adopted**, running or stopped. Only a database that cannot start is replaced, and the installer announces it. To restart a stopped database, prefer `exakit start` over re-installing.

## Verify the install

```bash
exakit status                                     # Status: running
exakit info                                       # connection panel
exapump sql -p starter-kit 'SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'   # end-to-end proof
```

A returned timestamp means the database works. MCP health: `exakit mcp-doctor` (reports `success` plus a per-client state map: connected, available, not installed).

## Updates

The kit installs a **tested set** of versions published by the maintainers, not the newest of each component. Two commands cover everything:

```bash
exakit update-check      # installed vs advertised, per component, with the exact command for each
exakit update            # apply what is waiting: kit scripts, exapump, MCP server, pyexasol — and, after asking, the database
```

What an agent needs to know:

- `exakit update` takes **seconds** for the quick components. A pending **database** update stops the database, so it is applied only for an answer the run was actually given: on a terminal the user is asked (`Stop the database and update the runtime now? [y/N]`), and on yes the command does the whole sequence itself — stop, update, restart, report.
- **An agent-driven run has no terminal, so the database update is never started on its own.** It is deferred with the exact command (`exakit update runtime`). Opt in deliberately with `exakit update --yes` or `EXAKIT_CONFIRM_RUNTIME_UPDATE=1`, and expect the database to be down for a minute or two. Ask the user first — the database is theirs, and other things may be connected to it.
- The runtime update keeps your data: the container is recreated over the same data volume and the previous image is put back if the new one does not come up. There is no data backup step because nothing deletes data. The one exception is an Exasol Personal **major** upgrade, which is a real data migration: `exakit update` never starts it, and `exakit update runtime --plan` prints its backup-gated steps.
- Nothing here can hang. Version resolution degrades to a cached copy, then to the copy that shipped with the kit; no command fails because an update check could not reach the network.
- `exakit update-check` is the only command that prints the full table. `exakit version` prints what is installed plus a short hint.
- If the advertised version is **older** than the installed one, nothing is offered and nothing is applied: `exakit update-check` shows an action of `none`, and asking for that component by name succeeds and does nothing. The kit has no downgrade path, by any route or override. To withdraw a faulty release, publish a higher version.
- A component that reports `not installed` (most often `pyexasol`, whose install step is deliberately non-fatal) is repaired by the same command: `exakit update pyexasol`.

## Marketplace add-ons (optional)

Optional tools live behind `exakit marketplace`, never in the install flow. Interactively it is a checkbox menu (Space selects, Enter installs); an agent answers with the environment instead:

```bash
EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS=dash-server exakit marketplace   # ids csv, or all / none
```

- **dash-server** — agent-operated Dash hosting: build live dashboards on the local database through its MCP control plane (`http://127.0.0.1:5100/mcp`; start it with `dash-server`).
- Once installed, an add-on updates through the normal flow (`exakit update dash-server`, and `exakit update` covers it). Add-ons that were never picked are never touched, and one already on the system outside the kit is respected, not managed.
- An interactive install ends with the same offer once everything ran; `EXAKIT_MARKETPLACE_ADDONS` pre-answers it (see the install answers table above).
- Building a NEW add-on for the marketplace is a development task, not an install step: the walkthrough with skeleton code is [MARKETPLACE.md](MARKETPLACE.md).

## Where things live

- State, credentials, logs: `~/.exasol-starter-kit/` (logs under `logs/`; every error message names its remedy, check there before improvising)
- Kit source copy (read any script): `~/.exasol-starter-kit/kit/`
- CLI binaries: `~/.local/bin/` (`exakit`, `exapump`, `exasol` on macOS, and `dash-server` once that add-on is installed)
- Never print or log the password files under `~/.exasol-starter-kit/credentials/`

## After the install

Install the agent skill so future sessions can drive the full ask, inspect SQL, run, validate loop:

```bash
exakit skills-install
```

Then see `skills/local-agent-ready-starter/SKILL.md` for the query-loop discipline (read-only MCP user, show SQL before running it).

## Uninstall

```bash
exakit uninstall --yes    # database + data, MCP configs, skills, binaries
```
